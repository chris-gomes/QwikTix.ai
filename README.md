# QwikTix.ai

This is a final project for a Database Design class. Our application source code is a python file, qwiktix.py.
In order to get the source code to run correctly, the packages 'mysqlclient' and 'bcrypt' need to be
installed.

These packages can be installed using pip:
`pip install mysqlclient bcrypt`

This process is more clearly outlined in this setup video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6pu0g3rrZ4
